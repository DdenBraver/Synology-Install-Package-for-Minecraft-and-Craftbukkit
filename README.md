## Original History

Colin Hildinger wanted to set up a private Minecraft server for his son.  I found work by patters at:

http://pcloadletter.co.uk/2012/01/11/minecraft-package-for-synology/

Unfortunately it hadn't been updated in about 2 years, but from the comments it was apparent that people were still
using it and manually updating the files.  Well, BLECH!  I decided to try to clean it up because, well, I'm a glutton
for punishment.
